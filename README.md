# pytorch_nn
Use this example - https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-your-first-neural-network-with-pytorch-step-by-step/ to understand pytorch NNs. Augment the dataset by perturbing the data fields with gaussian noise. Train/test/validate. Take a screencast walkthrough of the full code, including your understanding of how the NN is implemented.
